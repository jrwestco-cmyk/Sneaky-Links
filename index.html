        <!--I don't think I need to have these line breaks in here but
        I am not sure how to make it stack another way-->
        <p>The Hyperion Max 3 from Brooks Running has shocked the running community<br>
            around the world. The brand has always been reserved with creating daily trainers<br>
            for their suburban joggers and people who are on their feet all day. So when<br>
            Brooks Running launched their Hyperion Series a few years ago we had an idea that<br>
            there might be something different in the brands future. This year they unveiled it<br>
            with this shoe. Here is what you need to know; weight: 9.9 oz. (280 g) for a<br>
            US M9, 8.8 oz. (250 g) for a US W8, stack height and drop: 46 mm in heel,<br>
            40 mm in forefoot (6 mm drop), and price: $200.
        </p>

        <p>When Brooks Running sent me this shoe and I pulled it out of the box I was<br>
            surprised how tall it was. With a stack height of 46 mm this shoes does<br>
            not disappoint with lack of cushioning. When I tried them on for the first<br>
            time and took a lap around the house I felt unstable because I have never worn<br>
            a running shoe with that much height before. I immediately took them off and<br>
            placed them back in the box until further notice. I was afraid I was going to<br>
            roll an ankle if I took a turn too fast or worse fall on my face due to how soft<br>
            the shoe felt under my foot. As a runner who has returned from multiple running<br>
            injuries too many thoughts filled my head that could go wrong with this shoe.
        </p>

        <p>After about a week I saw the box again with the shoes in it and thought I should<br>
            try them again and take them for a run. Just a short run in the neighborhood,<br>
            nothing crazy. Well, that run turned into a few miles. I felt like I was flying<br>
            and in reality I was. I was running my mile times 2-3 minutes faster than I normally<br>
            do. I assumed it was all in my head and a shoe couldn't have that kind of power.
        </p>

        <p>The reality of it is, Brooks Running designed this shoe for speed. With a responsive<br>
            speed fault plate underfoot paired with race day foam… Some are calling it “Runners Gold”.<br>
            After giving this shoe a second chance I can see what all the hype is about. This shoe<br>
            will cost you around $200 which is the same value as other running shoes that are ranked<br>
            in the same performance category. So if you are in the market for a speed shoe go try it<br>
            on at your local running store, I would love to hear your thoughts on it!
        </p>
